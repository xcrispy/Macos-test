# Macos-test
# This is the recent macos test for metaplex

it may look like a folder here (or in vs code) but when you clone the app, run it from finder   
if it still looks like a folder in finder you can create an issue reporting that here   

this app is 250mb, you should be able to clone it and then look for it in finder and double click to open it   

when the app opens you will be presented with the image that looks like the one below

Then you will create a nickname and click the set nickname button that should take about 1-2mins to load if you are on a stable network.

here you can create room or join one and then when creating a server, you can input the name, while when joining a server, you will pick the server you want to join by the side (there could be none cause this could be empty so you wont really see any room), then after joining or creating a room you will be presented in the lobby option where you can select character.
